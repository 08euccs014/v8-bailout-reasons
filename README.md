# V8-Crankshaft-bailout
A list of Crankshaft bailout reasons with examples

---

Late last year I wrote a couple of [blog](https://vhf.github.io/blog/) posts about optimizing [Babel](https://babeljs.io) ES2015 to ES5 transpilation for V8 and [fixed](https://github.com/babel/babel/commits?author=vhf) a few issues I had with it.

I'm far from being a V8 expert but I enjoy trying to understand how things work, and since I'm a JavaScript enthousiast I decided to take a stab at listing Crankshaft bailout reasons (together with examples and advices) in a public git repository where everyone could contribute.
